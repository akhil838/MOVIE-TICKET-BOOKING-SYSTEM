
			The way of water connects all things. The sea is our home before our birth and
		after we die. Beyond the 3D visual spectacle that Avatar is, something we trust James
		Cameron to deliver, the franchiseâ€™s beauty lies in its underlying spiritual arc and 
		ode to continuity of life. Life finds a way. It evolves no matter the surroundings as
		love is transformative.
