		
		Hats off to Bobby handling such a simple script in a most entertaining way.
		You get to see vintage Chiru as veeriah with his comedy timing.
		Music - Devi is clear winner with his songs
		BGM - Devi did a wonderful job with BGM
		Fights - Ram Lakshman have elevated their levels with their choreography
		Production - Rich production values and kudos to the producers
		Ravi Teja - Perfect supporting role for punakalu loading 
		Chiru - Gave his best to his age and can't expect more from a 67 Years old legend.
		Direction - Bobby is a clear winner handling too many characters and packaging a simple story in a most entertaining way

		You will not be disappointed watching Veeraiah for this Sankranti ... Punakalu for fans & good feel for others.
