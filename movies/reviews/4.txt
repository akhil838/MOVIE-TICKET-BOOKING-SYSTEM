
			An event film of sorts, since it marks Shah Rukh Khan's return to the big 
		screen after four long years, Pathaan is an ambitious action thriller that plays
		to the gallery and lives up to the hype. Far-fetched in writing but high on star 
		power and style, Pathaan initially seems like a filmy Mountain Dew commercial 
		which slowly but steadily finds its footing.

		Overall Review: 4.0
