		
			On the whole, Michael didn't live up to the hype and was okay in parts. More
		focus was laid on the technical aspects. Hence the story and narrative were taken 
		a beating. Sundeep Kishan and Vijay Sethupathi are the saving grace in this 
		stretched action drama. You can give it a try but keep your expectations in check.

		Overall Rating: 3.0
